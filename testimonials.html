            <p class="testimonials-text">ACCESS is the only premier corporate sustainability case competition in the country. You encounter case competitions on marketing, finance, and operations on a regular basis, but you never see one singularly
              focused on sustainability. The opportunities for learning that this competition provided were wholly unique from others', which strongly encouraged me to join. Being a business major, I really wanted to learn how to creatively
              integrate sustainability into the foundation of a company. I thought that it was an entirely necessary advocacy given the current state of the Philippines and the world as a whole. ACCESS definitely fulfilled my expectations in every
              way. I think that I now hold the advocacy close to my heart, especially after having learned how important and beneficial it can be to incorporate sustainability into the core of a business. As I enter the corporate world, I will
              undoubtedly carry the sustainability practices that I learned from the competition with me wherever I go, in the hopes that I will be able to improve how business is conducted in the Philippines.

            <p class="testimonials-text">I joined ACCESS last year because I wanted to see how large companies such as Shell approach corporate sustainability. Apart from this, I also took notice of the competition because it allowed inter-school
              groups. I joined with 1 friend from ME, 2 friends from DLSU, and another friend from MIS. At the time, none of us had much knowledge on what exactly corporate sustainability is but we all wanted to learn about it. We came together and
              treated ACCESS as a learning opportunity from both Shell and each other. Although we didn't win, it was a great experience being able to share and debate ideas with competent people from different backgrounds. It was made even more fun
              because we were all helping each other learn about a concept novel to all of us.

            <p class="testimonials-text">I joined the competition last year cause i’ve always been a huge fan of the project — ACCESS has always been the flagship project of MEA and so i always thought highly of it. Also, it’s about corporate
              sustainability, which is something i’m interested in and something i want to learn more about. And it was perfect timing, cause 4 of the people I worked with over that summer wanted to join a case competition so we thought “hey why not
              join this one?” We honestly just joined to learn and to have fun, we were hoping to win of course but we never really expected much. We were just 5 friends who loved working with each other, and we’d get together 1-2 times a week at
              Matteo down at 9:00pm just to bounce ideas off each other and to get the ball rolling. I really am so glad i took the opportunity (despite the academic workload and other commitments) because this experience was everything i hoped for
              and more. I’ll be frank with you though- we worked hard and prayed for the best but never in our wildest dreams did we expect the outcome, and i think that this was an experience our team will forever be thankful for.More than this,
              ACCESS has not only helped me understand more about operational efficiency and sustainable energy sources, but also it has helped me form a more structured way of thinking and most importantly, it has taught me how to view current
              situations through a corporate sustainability lens. And no matter the outcome, in case competitions, it’s really more about the journey (+ learnings!!!) than the destination.

            <p class="testimonials-text">My ACCESS journey started because my friends and I simply wanted to take every opportunity that came to us in our graduating year. It seemed like the perfect competition to try, and true enough, it did not
              disappoint. It gave us incredible insights and first-hand experience on what it's like to create value for a company through true-to-life cases and projects, drawing inspiration from respected professionals who will guide you in your
              ACCESS journey. The competition definitely made me think in a more critical and creative manner, as it gives you challenges that are unexpected yet very fun and interesting. Having gone through the ACCESS experience, it surely is worth
              your time and effort & will not only enrich your collegiate life but also our own corporate careers in the future.

            <p class="testimonials-text">Being a freshman in UPD, I had put this pressure on myself to make the most of having a relatively ‘free schedule’. I wanted to invest my time and effort into endeavors that promised good insights and
              learning experiences and that’s when my friends invited me to join them in the ACCESS case competition, I was more than happy to do so! I wanted to expose myself to a healthy, productive, and competitive environment. I went into ACCESS
              with a goal to not only learn about corporate sustainability but to learn how to apply it in different fields, and I accomplished this goal! I learned so many new things and got to know what it was like to work with a team towards a
              common and concrete goal! The things I learned in ACCESS stayed with me even after the competition. I’ve grown to apply these learnings to different projects, initiatives, and campaigns. Because of ACCESS, I always keep in mind that in
              every line of work, we have a responsibility to the communities we are a part of and the environment from which we also take from.
